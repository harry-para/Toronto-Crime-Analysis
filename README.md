# Toronto Crime Analysis

This project used crime record data that was sourced from the Toronto Police Service Public Safety Data Portal (https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/mci-2014-to-2019).
Crime data was collected from 2015-2019. 

The purpose of this project was to compare Toronto neighbourhoods based on their crime levels. 

This crime analysis was able to use K-means clustering and regression analysis to classify neighbourhoods based on whether they had low, medium or high crime levels.

This analysis was able to combine crime record data and Toronto neighbourhood location data to use joins to build a large dataframe.
This analysis uses the pandas and numpy python libraries to showcase advanced skills in data cleaning and manipulation.
Data visualizations were also created to visualize the data as well as show the cluster analysis in the form of a map visualization.

This analysis used Google Sheets to store the Toronto neighbourhood location, Toronto crime datasets, and pandas dataframes online that were later used to produce data visualizations on Tableau.
